## Overview

The Sales Analytics Dashboard is a comprehensive solution for generating, processing, and analyzing sales data. It leverages Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration, Spark for analytics, and a web-based dashboard for visualization.

## Features

- **Data Generation**: Synthetic sales data generation using Airflow DAGs.
- **Data Processing**: Loading data into MySQL and performing analytics with Spark.
- **Dashboard**: Interactive web-based dashboard for visualizing sales trends and insights.

## Project Structure

- **airflow-docker/**: Contains the Airflow setup and DAGs for data generation, processing, and analytics.
  - `docker-compose.yaml`: Configuration for running Airflow in Docker.
  - `dags/`: Airflow DAGs for generating synthetic data, loading data to MySQL, and running Spark analytics.
  - `config/`: Configuration files for Airflow.
- **dashboard/**: Web application for visualizing sales data.
  - `app.py`: Main application file for the dashboard.
  - `templates/`: HTML templates for the dashboard.
  - `static/`: Static files like JavaScript for charts.
